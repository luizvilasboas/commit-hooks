# commit-hooks

> A Go-based CLI tool and Git hook to interactively create commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification.

## About the Project

This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to streamline the process of writing commit messages that adhere to the Conventional Commits standard. It integrates seamlessly with your Git workflow using a `prepare-commit-msg` hook.

When you run `git commit`, this tool intercepts the process, allowing you to enhance your initial message or build a new one from scratch through an interactive form. The tool is configurable, allowing you to define your own commit types and scopes via a TOML file.

## Tech Stack

The main technologies and libraries used in this project are:

* [Go](https://go.dev/)

* [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)

* [TOML](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml)

* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## Usage

Below are the instructions for you to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed to run this project:

* [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (v1.18 or higher)

* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Installation and Setup

Follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/luizvilasboas/commit-hooks.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

```
cd commit-hooks
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```
go mod tidy
````

4. **Install the Git hook**

You have two options for installation:

* **Local Installation (for this repository only)**
  This command will install the hook in the current project's `.git/hooks` directory.

  ```
  make install
  ```

* **Global Installation (for all your repositories)**
  This command installs the commit-hooks binary to `~/.local/bin` and configures Git to use it globally.

  ```
  make install-global
  ```

  **Important**: Ensure the installation directory (`~/.local/bin` by default) is in your shell's `$PATH`.

### Configuration

You can customize the available commit types and scopes by creating a `conventional_commits.toml` file in one of two locations:

1. `./data/conventional_commits.toml` (Project-specific)

2. `~/.commit_hooks/conventional_commits.toml` (Global fallback)

The file should follow this format:

```toml
# Example conventional\_commits.toml
types = ["feat", "fix", "docs", "style", "refactor", "test", "chore"]
scopes = ["api", "ui", "db", "auth", "deps"]
```

### Workflow

1. Make your changes and stage them with `git add`.

2. Run the commit command with a brief initial message:

```
git commit -m "add user login feature"
```

3. The interactive helper will launch automatically.

4. Follow the prompts to select a type, scope(s), and refine the commit message details.

5. Confirm your choices to finalize the structured commit message.
